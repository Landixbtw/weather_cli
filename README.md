This command line tool is actually my third attempt at a final project for cs50x 2024. My first attempt was trying to create a small operating system called [BridgeOS](https://github.com/Landixbtw/BridgeOS), but it got clear quite fast
that this was way out of scope for me. Altough this is not my final project, I will probably pick this up again when I know c better. Between working this low level and
implementing my own libc this would have been too hard, and taken too much time. My second attempt for a final project was remaking spaceinvaders with c and raylib.
But there where I had some big issues and I could not get around them, even after weeks of trying. Finally I had the idea for this weather_cli, it seemed hard enough but definitly
possible to do in time.

## üîó Dependencies
### Curl
You need [curl](https://curl.se) you can either [download](https://curl.se/download.html) it from the official website, or the build system ([meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html)) will download it for you since libcurl has a [meson wrapDB package](https://mesonbuild.com/Wrapdb-projects.html).

### Meson build system
For meson you **need python**. You can find installation methods for meson [here](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).
You also **need [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)**.

### Terminal image viewer
The weather_cli uses [timg](https://github.com/hzeller/timg/) to display the images on the terminal. Meson will check if timg is installed, if not it will not setup the builddir.

### cJSON
The [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme) library is shipped within the project source code.

> [!NOTE]
> THERE IS NO MAC SUPPORT CURRENTLY I DONT THINK THIS WORKS FOR MAC RIGHT NOW.
### MacOs
```zsh
brew install pkg-config
brew install ninja
brew install meson
brew install timg
```

### Arch Linux
```bash
pacman -S pkgconf
pacman -S ninja
pacman -S meson
yay -S timg
```

### Weatherstack API Key

Last but not least you need your Weatherstack API key, which you can get with a Weatherstack account.
You can sign up here: https://weatherstack.com/signup/free
(With the free API you get 250 request per month, for 10$ a month you get 50,000.)

**Before** using ```meson setup builddir``` you have to create the `"WEATHERSTACK_API_KEY.env"`
file in `src/resources` (if the folder does not exist, create it) and paste your api key.
Also use the correct format. ‚Üì

> [!NOTE]
> CORRECT FORMAT: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
> WRONG FORMAT: access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY

```bash
mkdir -p src/resources
echo "your_access_key" > src/resources/WEATHERSTACK_API_KEY.env
```
Altough the error message might say different, use the format that is here CORRECT.

## üöÄ Getting Started
###  Building the binary
As long as you have followed all the steps above.
Building should be as easy as.
```bash
meson setup builddir

cd builddir

meson compile
```

Building this has been tested on.
```bash
Linux tux 6.10.10-arch1-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC x86_64 GNU/Linux
Linux tux 6.11.3-arch1-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

## Installing the cli
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. AND I WILL NOT HELP TROUBLESHOOT.

If you still choose to install, I will not be able help you troubleshoot.  
I _might_ work on getting this ready, but no promises made.  
You can uncomment the following line in the ```meson.build``` file.

```build
executable(
  meson.project_name(),
  ['src/main.c', 'src/terminal_support.c', 'src/cJSON.c', 'src/image_to_ascii.c', 'src/terminal_display_picture.c'],
  dependencies: [curL_deps],
  include_directories: inc_dir,
  link_with: lib,
  build_by_default: true,
 --> install: true <--
 --> install_dir: 'your/destination/path' <--
)
```
```bash
meson install
```

This will install the cli to the default path. You can also set a custom path.

If you want to read more about meson install you can read here [here](https://mesonbuild.com/Installing.html).

##  Using the weather cli

After building the programm, you can just execute ./weather_cli
with no options to get a usage screen. That looks something like this.

```
‚ùØ ./weather_cli

Usage: ./weather_cli [city]

A command-line tool to display weather information about a city

For city names capitalization does not matter.
Washington or washington.
For cities that have a [space] in between you have to enter a plus.
New+York or new+york.
```

> [!Important]
> On MacOS you might need to execute both commands with sudo.
> Also when running the binary
> sudo ./weather_cli Berlin.
> It might not let you compile, and when running without sudo the .json
> and .png files might not be created.


## How it works

- Files in the project what do they do

---------
The ```src/main.c``` file handles, taking the user input, building the url with the build_url() function, with the city, and API key. It also handles the "umlaute" if the city name 
has them (For example M√ºnchen -> Muenchen). The weatherstack cannot handle the umlaute so this is necesarry.
It takes the json data it gets to from the api and writes it into a json file so that it can be read and displayed to the console with the help of [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON). 
It does all the parsing and checking of the json data.

We first have to parse the json file with the [cJSON_Parse](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/blob/master/cJSON.c#L1195) function, to then be able to disect it with the cJSON library, to display the parts we want. We read the json file with all the data, into a buffer and then into the function.
```c
while (fread(buffer, file_size , 1, temp_json_file)) {
    json = cJSON_Parse(buffer);
}
```
We can then access the data like this:
```c
location = cJSON_GetObjectItemCaseSensitive(json, "location");
if (location != NULL) {
    name = cJSON_GetObjectItemCaseSensitive(location, "name");
    if (cJSON_IsString(name) && (name->valuestring != NULL )) {
        fprintf(stdout, "\033[4mWeather report for:\033[0m ");
        fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", name->valuestring);
    }
}
```

The Object in this case "location", is a json object 
```json
"location":{"name":"New York","country":"United States of America","region":"New York","lat":"40.714","lon":"-74.006","timezone_id":"America\/New_York","localtime":"2024-10-19 18:51","localtime_epoch":1729363860,"utc_offset":"-4.0"}
```

Which we look for in the json file, if we find it, we then look for the "name", 
if this is a string, and the valuestring is not NULL we display it on the terminal.
This is basically how all of it works.

## Converting characters

I am German, and in the german language there are so called "[umlaute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_%28linguistics%29)" these are letters with the small dots over them √∂ √§ √º. Some city names most notably M√ºnchen have these. I had to discover that the weatherstack API does not support these umlaute.
So I thought about how I can detect them and convert them to oe ae ue, which means the same but is a format that the weatherstack api can read and process.
So M√ºnchen becomes Muenchen. I tried over days, with many different approaches, but could not figure out. You can still find my inital
attempts on trying to convert the characters, at the bottom of the ```main.c``` file. Eventually I caved and asked [claude.ai](https://www.claude.ai/new).

!!! MORE DETAIL ON HOW THIS WORKS

## Getting and downloading the weather picture (terminal_display_picture.c)

The API this is all built on is the [weatherstack API](https://www.weatherstack.com).
It provides us with all the information needed, and even provides a link to a picture.
The picture that is being displayed / downloaded, is dependant on the weather of the
city we are trying to look up. The picture is then being downloaded with curl.


## Displaying the picture on the command line

Displaying the image on the command line is as easy as checking if the user has one of the
"supported" terminal image viewers installed on their system and executing a command.
With ```popen()``` we can pipe the output directly onto the terminal.


## Determining the terminal emulator protocol (terminal_support.c)
Different terminal emulators, use different protocols, for example:

- xterm
- xterm-256color
- xterm-kitty
- iTerm.app
- mlterm

Some are able to display pictures, and some are not, so in the ```terminal_support.c``` file,
we are checking which protocol your terminal emulator is using.
This way we can display different things depending on the outcome, on some terminals you will see a small picture with what the weather currently looks like.
And for some you will just get a small text telling you that your terminal emulator cannot display pictures, or you may get ascii art.
If you want a terminal that can display pictures, you should choose one with the following protocols: xterm-256color, xterm-kitty or iTerm.app.
Some would be:
- [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html)
- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)


TODO:
- Go more into detail with term emulator protocol ?
- Make more code comments ?

- If not weatherstack api key file detected, ask user for api key, and make file echo the key, into the file
